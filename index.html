                    <button class="accordion">What is a Hackathon?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A hackathon is a coding marathon - it's like a real-time programming fair where students develop an idea and bring it to life through code. A project could be a game, website, app, robot, Arduino project, whatever! If you enjoy programming or technology in general, hackathons are great places to meet friendly, like-minded people.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Do I need to know how to code?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops, learn some code, and still submit a project.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Who can attend?</button>

                        <p>The only thing you need is a device that can connect to the internet, and any materials needed for creating your hack!</p>

                        <p>Anyone caught working on past projects will be forced to sit in the corner and wear the dunce hat. Seriously though, don't be that one guy.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">What if I don't have a team?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No problem! Many participants arrive without a team, and you can meet and work with new people. You can also choose to work alone. The limit is 4 people per team.</p>

                        <p>At some point, Freddy had a cheesy description here. However, we can't seem to decide what Freddy is, so we'll just say he's that one duck you keep seeing around incomplete parts of this website.</p>
